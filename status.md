Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have used code.org to make a game that gives the user the option of choosing difficulty of the level and once the user clicks on the button, i have created many obsticles that range from size and speed. I have also created a screen for when you win the game and i made it so you respawn whenever you die. the deaths are counted and displayed on the top left with a counter. 
#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I want to make it multi-level and change some of the obsticles directions to make it unpredictable. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have encountered some such as having to relearn Javascript and having to relearn how to use code.org but the most difficult problem i faced was making it so the cube doesnt go though walls, this took quite a bit of trial and error but i found out how to do it. I found out that trying to program the cube to not go though a single solid block was too difficult and i was stuck on trying to figure it out for a day or so, then i finally realized i can split the block in two to program each block to focus on one side.
