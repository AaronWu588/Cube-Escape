Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have used code.org to make a game that gives the user the option of choosing difficulty of the level and once the user clicks on the button, i have created 5 obsticles that go left and right and the player can use the keys W,A,S,D to move and try to evade the obsticles. i have put text in the middle of the screen when you die and when you complete the game. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I want to make it multi-level and change some of the obsticles directions to make it unpredictable. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have encountered some such as having to relearn Javascript and having to relearn how to use code.org.
