# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project
cube evade

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A cube game with the objective to evade all the moving obsticles. The player can pick what difficulty they would like to play before the start of the game.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The project is a cube game with moving obsticles for the player to evade. the player can control the cube with the keys W,A,S, and D. W is forward, A is left, D is right, and S is backward. the obsticles move at a certain speed, correlating to the difficulty the player chooses before the game starts, for example, if the player chooses easy, the obsticles will move slower, and if the player chooses hard then the obsticles will move faster. there will be a option for random, which makes the each obsticles move at randomly generated speed. there will be 5 moving blocks with the objective of making it to the other side without hitting any of the blocks. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accoplish creating the game, coding the cube to move with W,A,S,D, and make the moving objects.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think i can accomplish showing text when you fail the game and when you complete the game, and a start screen with the option of difficulty the player can choose before playing. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I want to create a multi level cube game, something like the impossible game with each level getting harder and harder, with the same application that the levels difficulty is correlated to the players initial decision. 


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

This project will be programmed in javascript, and I've had some experience with javascript in my senior year of highschool taking AP computer science Principals. I will have to referbish my memory and review some of my old notes from that class. I will also have to research some of the basics and understand it.
